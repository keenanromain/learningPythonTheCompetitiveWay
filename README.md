# learningPythonTheCompetitiveWay

Teaching myself python3 through competitive coding. Currently using <a href="https://codefights.com">codefights.com</a> with plans to explore <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> in the future.

## Key Details

I wanted to emphasize solving the given problems in as much as a pythonic way as possible, so I've included explanations that can help someone who routinely codes closer to the iron. I've also included the question prompts for the casual readers.

During my first week on CodeFights, I appeared among the top 20 coders worldwide which was something I was happy to see.
