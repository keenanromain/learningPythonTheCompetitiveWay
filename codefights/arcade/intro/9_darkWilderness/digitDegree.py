"""
Let's define digit degree of some positive integer as the number of times we need to replace this number with the sum of its digits until we get to a one digit number.
Given an integer, find its digit degree.
Example
    For n = 5, the output should be
    digitDegree(n) = 0;
    For n = 100, the output should be
    digitDegree(n) = 1.
    1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
    For n = 91, the output should be
    digitDegree(n) = 2.
    9 + 1 = 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1.
Input/Output
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
    [input] integer n
    Guaranteed constraints:
    5 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 109.
    [output] integer
