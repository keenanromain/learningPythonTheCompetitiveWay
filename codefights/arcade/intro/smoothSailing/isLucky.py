"""
Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.
Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.
Example
    For n = 1230, the output should be
    isLucky(n) = true;
    For n = 239017, the output should be
    isLucky(n) = false.
Input/Output
    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
    [input] integer n
    A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.
    Guaranteed constraints:
    10 â‰¤ n < 106.
    [output] boolean
    true if n is a lucky ticket number, false otherwise.
